# Eight-Puzzle
applying state-space search to solve any valid initial configuration of the Eight Puzzle

#Description
The Eight Puzzle is a 3x3 grid containing 8 numbered tiles and one empty or blank cell.
Tiles that are adjacent to the blank cell can move into that position in the grid, and solving the puzzle involves moving the tiles until you reach the goal state where the top left corner box is empty and the numbers in each box increase in ascending order from left to right across rows. This project applies the concept of state-space search to complete the task.
